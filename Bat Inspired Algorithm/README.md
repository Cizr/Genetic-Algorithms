# Bat Algorithm

The **Bat Algorithm** is a nature-inspired optimization method based on the echolocation behavior of fruit bats. It simulates the bats' ability to locate prey using a combination of loudness and pulse rate. These parameters help balance exploration (searching new solutions) and exploitation (refining the best solution found so far).

Bats "fly" through the solution space, adjusting their positions based on fitness values and the best-known solution. This makes it effective for solving complex optimization problems, including pathfinding, machine learning, and resource allocation.

Similar to other swarm intelligence algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), the Bat Algorithm is simple yet powerful, making it suitable for various real-world applications.
